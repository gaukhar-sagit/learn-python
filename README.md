# 🧠 Gaukhar's Python & AI Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my learning repository — here I’m documenting my journey from beginner Python programmer to future AI engineer 👩‍💻

---

## 🎯 About Me
I'm a Computer Science student at DMU Kazakhstan, currently focusing on Python and core CS fundamentals. I'm also independently studying AI/ML to prepare for internships in Europe (2026–2027).
